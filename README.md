# Car Dealer App

This project is a full-stack application for a car dealer using Next.js. It allows users to filter vehicles by type and model year, and view the results on a separate page. To get started, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/mateotoniolo/car-dealer-app.git`, navigate to the `front-end` directory with `cd car-dealer-app/front-end`, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and start the development server with `npm run dev`. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. The project structure includes the `app/` directory for all Next.js pages and components, `components/` for reusable UI components, `services/` for API call files, and `page.tsx` as the entry point. Additional files include `.env` for environment variables configuration, `.eslintrc.json` for ESLint configuration, and `.prettierrc` for Prettier configuration. For more information, refer to the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
